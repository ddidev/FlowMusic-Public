The code here is probably from an unreleased version before the end of time, so enjoy the extra stuff e.g lyrics which never saw the light of day
Packages are a little bit outdated, but updating everything to latest (Which should happen automatically on first run) should be fine! Major releases are not automatically updated.

Feel free to use, but please give credits.

# Setup
